## Events
* No overtly offensive jokes (ie, sexism, rape, etc)
* No weird unicode (ie, RTL, LTR changing) at this time - lets keep it interpretable by every client

## Code
* Follow the existing code style
* When working on one issue, move your existing code into a new branch and work out of that branch. I will not accept numerous PRs regarding one issue.
* Please test your code. I can't test everything myself.
* When implementing gameplay changes, new classes, spells, etc, please at least leave the game run in your console for an hour just to make sure all is working correctly.

### Things to Update When Working With Code
* If you've added an achievement, you're good to go. There's currently no list of achievements.
* If you've added a spell, you're good to go. There's currently no list of spells.
* If you've added or updated a personality, please update the [wiki page](https://github.com/seiyria/IdleLands/wiki/Personalities) to reflect your changes
* If you've added a class, please add some [monsters](https://github.com/seiyria/IdleLands/blob/master/assets/data/monsters/monster.txt#L202) to reflect the new class. Feel free to get creative when describing the orcish, kobold, etc versions of your class.
