Idle Lands
=========

An incremental game (read: idling) where you do nothing while your character fights to be the best in the realm. 

It can be run with a backend of IRC, or a console, or really just about anything you plug into it. I'm sure it'd be pretty cool if you hooked it up to a MeteorJS backend (I did this for the [web view](http://idle.land/s/))! Currently, I use it as a module for my IRC bot, [Kurea](https://github.com/kellyirc/kurea) -- nothing special.

Developing
==========
Whether you want to create events, or create the next best class, all of the information is housed in the [wiki](https://github.com/seiyria/IdleLands/wiki/New-Developer-Guide)!

If you're more interested in content development (events, monsters, items, etc) click [here](https://github.com/seiyria/IdleLands/wiki/New-Developer-Guide#content-development).

If you're more interested in code development (backend, spells, classes, personalities, etc) click [here](https://github.com/seiyria/IdleLands/wiki/New-Developer-Guide#code-development).
